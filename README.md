# Bikestream
Repo for the Bikestream project (aka Databike Pilot Project).

Bikestream is an applied research project in the transportation sector, specifically micromobility, for developing open source, democratized, and decentralized approaches to data management (sourcing, collecting, storing, sharing, etc.) and design of electric-assisted bicycles ("e-bikes").

To put our approaches into action, we develop proof-of-concepts (PoCs) to showcase the use of our approaches, so that our approaches may be replicated and adapted to fit the needs of local communities, researchers, cyclists, organizations, and many more. Through our PoCs, we also get a chance to develop busienss cases for the Bikestream project as commercialization opprortunties for our contributors and partners. 

Our main theme for Bikestream is developing approaches that rely on relatively low-cost physical parts and open source software and designs, with an emphasis on utilizing emering technologies in the Web3 space for such purposes. 

Our first PoC is the Databike Zeta 001 (DBZ-001), a PoC to convert a traditional bicycle into an e-bike, and then add on-board computers (Cycle Analyst 3 and Raspberry Pi 3 B+) to log, manipulate, and share geolocation data and electrical part data ("databike") with a blockchain-based data sharing services, in this case being Streamr. 

Through the project, we hope to connect with other researchers and organizations who share similar views and missions, and to educate others about the importance of data (i.e., data literacy) and the uses of e-bikes, especially in a citizen science context. 

We have successfully developed the DBZ-001 and are excited about the prospects of the future of this project.
