# Bikestream
Repo for the Bikestream project (aka Databike Pilot Project).

Bikestream is an applied research project in the transportation sector, specifically micromobility, for developing alternative (open source, democratized, and decentralized) approaches to data governance (sourcing, collecting, storing, sharing, etc.) and mobility autonomy (e.g., open design of electric-assisted bicycles ("e-bikes")).

To put our approaches into action, we develop proof-of-concepts (PoCs) to showcase the use of our approaches, so that our approaches may be replicated and adapted to fit the needs of local communities, researchers, cyclists, organizations, and many more. Through our PoCs, we also get a chance to develop busienss cases for the Bikestream project as commercialization opprortunties for our contributors and partners. 

Our main theme for Bikestream is developing approaches that rely on relatively low-cost physical parts and open source software and designs, with an emphasis on utilizing emerging technologies in the Web3 space for such purposes. 

Our first PoC is the Databike Zeta 001 (DBZ-001), a PoC to convert a traditional bicycle into an e-bike, and then add on-board computers (Cycle Analyst 3 and Raspberry Pi 3 B+) to log, manipulate, and share geolocation data and electrical part data ("databike") with a blockchain-based data sharing services, in this case being Streamr. 

Through the project, we hope to connect with other researchers and organizations who share similar views and missions, and to educate others about the importance of data (i.e., data literacy) and the uses of e-bikes, especially in a citizen science context. 

We have successfully developed the DBZ-001 and are excited about the prospects of the future of this project.

# How to contribute
## DIY e-bikes

1. Make your own databike based on the databike report and customize it to meet your own needs
2. Make your own databike based on the databike report but at a cheaper price than we our databike
3. Make an open source rame design with BikeCAD or databikes

## Data Cooperative

1. Create a stream on Streamr and add your stream to the Mobility Data Cyclist's Union product on the Streamr Marketplace. 
2. Help us create a multi-stakeholder model or databikes and mobility data in general that tracks the liecycle o a databike.

## Citizen Science

1. Expand the databike by also adding a vibration sensor to the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ or using the vibration sensor on your smartphone or mobile phone to report on road conditions in your local area and stream the data on Streamr or provide the data to civil engineers and transportation proessionals in your area. 
2. Help us create educational materials on _DIY e-bikes_, _mobility data_, _e-bike market_, _sensor data_, _geolocation data_, _riding bicycles_, _bicycle maintenance_, and much more. 

## Data Analytics

1. Help us develop a machine learning model to help optimize cyclist perormance so that e-bike parts can last longer while improving the cyclist's human power. 
2. Help us make a visualization o geolocation data (i.e., geomap) with Lealet.js

## Events

1. Attend (and/or share with your riends) one o our inormational events on the Bikestream project

## Parts

1. Help us by donating below to purchase new parts or the databike such as a _smart-lock_ or _PAS sensor_

## Applications

1. Help us develop or ind an open source mobile application or tracking or renting databikes in real-time (like Lime).
2. Help us connect a smart-lock to a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
3. Help us develop an Ethereum DApp that records smart-lock events  

## Issues
1. Send us your thoughts on issues plaguing mobility data, micro-mobility industry, cycling, location data, or other related areas

## Donation

1. You can donate to us to help pay some o the costs o the project via the link below.
